# MINOR tag on purpose — never a patch pin. `3.11.8-slim` sat here while the
# matrix said 3.12 and render.yaml said 3.12.0: three declared Pythons, none
# tested against the image, and the patch pin meant the image never received
# a 3.11.x security release either (ops-seat finding, 2026-08-25). The minor
# tag tracks patch releases through Docker Hub; the minor itself is the ONE
# fleet Python, and tests/test_python_version.py pins that this tag, the CI
# matrix main and render.yaml's PYTHON_VERSION all agree — while /healthz
# reports the serving interpreter so the wire can contradict a stale image.

# Unbuffered stdout, or none of the app's print() diagnostics ever reach the

# sat invisible in Render while logging-based lines sailed through on
# stderr. An entire misconfiguration class debugs itself once these print.

# curl only — the HEALTHCHECK below uses it. Deliberately NO nodejs/npm:

# dash-mantine-components' component-build toolchain, inherited through the
# fork lineage and used by NOTHING in this repo (no webpack config, no
# src/ts, no CI job, no served asset) — while shipping a known-vulnerable
# jsonpath into every production image (template issue #12, CVE-2026-1615,
# removed upstream in 1.6.9 and carried here with this Dockerfile sync). A
# docs site is a Python app; if a fork genuinely builds JS components it adds
# its own toolchain knowingly, not by inheritance.

# CACHE SEMANTICS (the round-2 fleet lesson, found by pannellum
# 2026-08-22): this layer re-runs ONLY when vendor/ or requirements.txt
# bytes change. A `>=` floor can NEVER pull a newer release through a
# cache hit — a code-only commit rebuilds the app layers below while pip
# silently keeps whatever version the image was first built with. Ship
# every dependency upgrade as a floor bump in requirements.txt (grep the
# number — it also lives in run.py's boot floor and the tests): the bump
# IS the cache bust, and the boot floor turns a stale image from a
# silent downgrade into a loud refusal to start.
