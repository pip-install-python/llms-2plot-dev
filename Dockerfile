# dash-improve-my-llms installs from PyPI. vendor/ holds dash_clerk_auth

# so vendor/ MUST be copied before the requirements install. Auth stays
# gated at runtime: no CLERK_* keys, no login wall.

# CACHE SEMANTICS (the round-2 fleet lesson, found by pannellum
# 2026-08-22): this layer re-runs ONLY when vendor/ or requirements.txt
# bytes change. A `>=` floor can NEVER pull a newer release through a
# cache hit — a code-only commit rebuilds the app layers below while pip
# silently keeps whatever version the image was first built with. Ship
# every dependency upgrade as a floor bump in requirements.txt (grep the
# number — it also lives in run.py's boot floor and the tests): the bump
# IS the cache bust, and the boot floor turns a stale image from a
# silent downgrade into a loud refusal to start.

# alone, without letting pip see the spurious pin. CI asserts the resulting
