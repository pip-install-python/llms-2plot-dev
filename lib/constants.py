# Site identity — one string, every surface
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The network standard (2plot.ai and 2plot.dev both ship it): a site states
# what it is, in the same words, on every surface an agent or a reader can
# reach. The surfaces this brand has to reach, and what serves each:
#
#   Dash(title=SITE_BRAND)              -> <title>, and the fallback identity
#   register_page_metadata(path="/",    -> the /llms.txt H1 and the llms
#       name=SITE_BRAND)                   viewer's brand chip, both via
#                                          dash-improve-my-llms 2.3.4's
#                                          `resolve_site_title`
#   pages/home.md's opening `# ` line   -> the home page's own prose
#
# tests/test_site_identity.py pins all four to this constant, because the
# failure is silent: `resolve_site_title` skips generic candidates ("Home",
# "Index", Dash's default "Dash"), so a site that never states its identity
# publishes a nav label or a framework default and nothing looks broken. That
# is exactly what this host did before — the viewer chip read a bare "Dash".
#
# Naming rules, from the network standard:
#   - the PACKAGE NAME belongs in the description, not in the brand;
#   - "Pip Install Python" is the byline (who made it), never the site name.

# advertised a different site while `<title>`, `og:site_name` and the

# app because nobody sees their own share cards.

# The network's internal-traffic contract
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The analytics point of truth is https://2plot.ai/docs/satellite-analytics
# ("Internal traffic"): any request whose User-Agent contains
# INTERNAL_UA_TOKEN is 2plot network machinery talking to itself — the hub's
# hourly health sweep, CI smoke batteries, the 4x-daily heartbeat, this app's
# own server-to-server calls to the hub. It is counted NOWHERE.
#
# Two halves, and both are required for the contract to hold:
#
#   inbound  — every tracker drops a token-carrying request at WRITE time,
#              before device detection and before bot classification, so it
#              never reaches the ledger the hourly rollup is built from;
#   outbound — every call this host makes to another network host sends
#              INTERNAL_UA, so the far side can apply the same rule.
#
# The outbound half is the one that was missing here. lib/ad_client.py fetched
# campaigns from 2plot.dev as bare `python-requests`, which the hub's own
# tracker classifies as a bot — every page view on this satellite was inflating
# 2plot.dev's bot_hits. lib/satellite_reporter.py and lib/hub_client.py had the
# same shape.
#
# The token string must stay byte-identical across the network; it mirrors
# 2plotai/lib/constants.py and pip-docs+/lib/constants.py.

# forked from. A satellite that forks it and never changes this value emits
#     <link rel="canonical" href="https://boilerplate.2plot.dev/...">
# on every one of its pages — which tells Google that the entire satellite is
# a duplicate of the boilerplate and asks for it to be dropped from the index.
# Traffic disappears and nothing in the app looks broken.
#
# So: override APP_BASE_URL per deployment. `require_owned_base_url()` below

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The social card
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TEMPLATE VALUE: a fork points this at its own image and changes nothing else.
#
# Dash builds `og:image` and `twitter:image` for every page (dash/_pages.py).
# When no `image_url=` is passed it INFERS one from the assets folder, looking
# for `<page>.<ext>`, then `app.<ext>`, then `logo.<ext>` — and this repo ships
# `assets/logo.svg`, so it inferred that. Two separate failures followed, both
# invisible from inside the app:
#
#   1. SVG is not a valid social image. Facebook, Twitter/X, LinkedIn and
#      Slack all reject it, so the card fell back to no image at all;
#   2. it DUPLICATED the og:image already declared in templates/index.html.
#      Two tags, and the scraper picks — usually the last, which was the SVG.
#
# Passing an explicit absolute `image_url` at register_page time resolves both:
# it overrides the inference, and it lets index.html stop declaring the URL
# itself and keep only the auxiliary width/height/alt tags Dash never emits.
#
# THE CARD LIVES ON THE CDN, NOT IN assets/. Network rule, and it is about
# cold starts rather than tidiness: a card served by the app is fetched by the
# scraper at unfurl time, and on a cold free-tier container that request lands
# mid-wake and times out. The preview renders blank ONCE and the platform
# caches the miss — so the first person to share the link poisons it for
# everyone. The CDN has no cold start.
#
# Rendered by `scripts/make_social_card.py` (1200x630 = 1.91:1, the Open Graph
# ideal, which also degrades cleanly into Twitter's 2:1 slot) and uploaded by
# hand to the Cloudflare bucket. There is no automated path to that bucket.
#
# Until 1.2.3 this was `{BASE_URL}/assets/ddb.png` — the app-served 784x741
# logo. Honest dimensions, but near-square: `summary_large_image` letterboxed
# it into a wide slot with bars either side.
#
# The width and height MUST match the file. A declared size that disagrees is
# worse than declaring none, because the platform reserves that box and crops
# into it. `tests/test_social_card.py` pins these against
# `templates/index.html`, and `scripts/smoke_live.py` fetches the real file
# after every deploy and checks its actual pixels against them — the only
# check that can catch the CDN object being replaced with something a
# different shape.
