# AI/LLM Integration & SEO — dash-improve-my-llms 2.2
# 2.0 replaced the custom Flask-only routes that used to live in this file
# (`/<page>/llms.txt`, `/<page>/page.json`, `/<page>/llms.toon`) with a single
# backend-detecting dispatcher covering Flask, FastAPI and Quart; `/page.json`
# and `/llms.toon` were dropped outright (Dash 4.3 MCP covers the structured
# introspection they were doing).
#
# 2.2 adds, on top of that: merge (not assign) semantics in
# register_page_metadata so no later call can erase a page's prose, a
# prerender that serves the content to every visitor rather than only to
# recognised crawlers, a Markdown renderer that emits real anchors/tables/code
# fences, and `register_network` — the cross-host directory fed by
# lib/network_directory.py below.
#
# Also new in 2.2: a page's llms.txt opens with a nav block back to the site
# and network indexes rather than being a dead end, and the same URL
# content-negotiates — Markdown for agents, a rendered view for browsers.
# (2.1 was assigned during development and never published; 2.0 upgrades
# straight to 2.2.)

# The version requirements.txt pins. Checked at startup — see the floors block
# below for why this is worth a line of output on every boot.
#
# 2.5.1 was the Tier-B SEO standard: `configure_seo` (icons, social card,
# publisher/sameAs), the crawler <title> carrying the site name, per-page
# `title`/`image_url`/`schema_type` actually reaching the crawler document,
# /favicon.ico answered with a redirect instead of the app shell, and a
# prerender that no longer clobbers the browser's per-page <title>.
# 2.6.0 raises it to the honesty standard: sitemap <lastmod> is emitted
# verbatim from `register_page_metadata(lastmod=)` and OMITTED when unset.
# The floor is load-bearing for HONESTY, not crash avoidance: older
# packages take `lastmod=` into **kwargs and silently ignore it (measured
# on 2.5.1 by the pip-docs+ stage-4 session, 2026-08-21 — the signature is
# `(path, name=None, description=None, llms_doc=None, **kwargs)`), so
# below the floor every date this repo stamped is swallowed and the
# sitemap goes back to swearing everything changed at build time. Also in
# 2.6.0: icon autodiscovery (this app still declares explicitly; the two
# must agree — tests/test_seo_icons.py), JSON-LD publisher.logo, and the
# viewer banner de-dup.
# 2.6.1 moved the floor again: below it the universal prerender ships with
# a literal `hidden` attribute, so every visibility-respecting consumer
# (html-to-text extractors, plausibly crawler content-weighting) reads
# "Loading..." instead of the page's prose — the outside-audit finding of
# 2026-08-22. tests/test_pages.py pins the visible shape.
# `configure_seo` is deliberately imported AFTER this floor fires (see the
# floors block) so a stale environment gets the floor's diagnosis instead of
# a bare ImportError.

# DISAGREE: the byte-copied reporter says "boilerplate" while the
# fork's other modules say its own key, so an unset SATELLITE_APP_KEY
# files the fork's traffic under the TEMPLATE's hub row (found live on
# pannellum, 2026-08-21 — the same class as the flows-reported-as-
# boilerplate contamination in the hub's history). setdefault: a real
# env value (Render dashboard, .env — loaded by lib/backend before
# this runs on import chains that need it) always wins; this line only

# makes no request and the viewer header renders fine on the package's

# The country guardrail (dash-improve-my-llms 2.7.0 — docs/GEO.md).
#
# Wired UNCONDITIONALLY, with the callable form. Three reasons it is not
# behind an `if`:
#
#   1. An empty denylist is a strict no-op — every response is byte-identical
#      to a build that never calls this. The inherited 322-test suite runs
#      with the seam live and proves it.
#   2. The seam's whole promise is "no restart". Gating the CALL on a env var
#      would mean the first country the owner ever blocks costs a redeploy,
#      which is the problem the callable exists to solve.
#   3. `deny_countries=` validates a STATIC list at config time and raises;
#      the callable form cannot, so the store validates on write instead
#      (lib/policy_store.normalize_country) and this line can never raise at
#      boot on a bad stored value.
#
# `unknown=` is NOT a seam — the package reads it once, here — so the board
# labels it "applies at next deploy" rather than pretending otherwise.
#
# THE TRUST MODEL, restated because it is easy to lose: the country comes
# from an edge header. Behind Cloudflare CF-IPCountry is trustworthy and
# client copies are stripped; a client that reaches this origin directly can
# say anything. This is a compliance guardrail, not a security boundary — if
# the block matters adversarially, add the Cloudflare country WAF rule too.
# The per-host check is the panel's "resolved to X via <header>" line, and
# on a DNS-only host every request resolves "unknown" and this ships inert.
