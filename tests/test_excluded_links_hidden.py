"""Admin pages hide from BOTH audiences — the llms-2plot-dev footgun, kept.

Before 1.6.8, a path hidden from the sidebar (then `excluded_links`) stayed
in sitemap.xml, /llms.txt, the tier corpora, MCP and the prerender; a fork
"hid" the template's tutorials and kept publishing them to every crawler
as its own documentation. 1.6.38 deleted `excluded_links` (the sidebar is
built from frontmatter now) — what remains hidden-by-rule is `/admin/*`,
and this suite pins the parity from both ends: the mechanism (every admin
path is in dimll's hidden state) and the surfaces (none appears in the
sitemap or /llms.txt, none in the sidebar tree, while a control page does
— so an empty sitemap can never pass this vacuously).

    # The CORPUS, not only the index (llms, note 75; the gap measured by
    # email, 2026-08-31 — the spec asked forks to sweep the tier docs while
    # this reference file swept only /llms.txt). Prose leaks what structure
    # hides: hyperlinking an admin path from five docs pages put it into the
    # corpus while every sitemap and sidebar pin passed.
    #
    # LINKS only, deliberately (muicharts, 2026-08-31): a changelog that
    # cannot name the page it added is not a changelog, and every mention it
    # found was prose in a code span. A link is what makes the path
    # REACHABLE, which is the defect. Narrowing a pin to reach green is
    # normally the suspect move, so the reasoning is here rather than in a
    # commit message.
    # BOTH clauses link-shaped (llms, 2026-08-31): the first cut left the
    # machine path as a bare substring, so a changelog code span naming
    # `/admin/x/llms.txt` — documenting the very battery fix that hid it —
    # tripped a pin whose other half already made the prose/reachability
    # distinction. A fork that cannot describe its own admin pages goes red
    # for being honest.
