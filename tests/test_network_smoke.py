"""Run the network battery against the in-process app.

`scripts/network_smoke.py` only ever executes in two places a developer never
watches: against the container CI just booted, and against production after a
deploy. That is exactly the code that rots — a typo in a check turns it into a
silent pass and the battery keeps reporting green over a broken host.

So it runs here too, with its `fetch` pointed at the test client. Three
distinct things get proven, and it is worth being explicit about which:

1. the battery's own logic still works (the checks fire, and they can fail);
2. this app satisfies every check the network standard makes of a satellite;
3. the per-site block at the top of the script — the expected H1, the hidden
   paths — still matches the app it describes.

What it cannot prove is the deployed artifact, which is the whole reason the
container run and the post-deploy run exist as well.
