"""The forwarded-scheme fix — `lib/proxy.py`.

TEMPLATE FILE: satellites copy this verbatim.

What shipped to production and stayed there: Dash builds `twitter:url` from
`request.url`, the request arrives over Cloudflare -> Render -> gunicorn, and
the last hop is plain HTTP, so every social scraper was told

    <meta property="twitter:url" content="http://boilerplate.2plot.dev/">

`og:url` looked right the whole time because `templates/index.html` hard-codes
it, and the template's client-side URL sync cannot help either — scrapers do
not run JavaScript. So the only place this is observable from inside the
codebase is here.

The unit tests below drive the middleware directly rather than through the
test client, because a test client synthesises its own environ and would not
reproduce a proxy hop. `test_the_tag_dash_emits_follows_the_forwarded_scheme`
is the end-to-end one: it asserts the actual meta tag, which is the thing that
was wrong.
