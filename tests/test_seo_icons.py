"""dimll 2.6.0's SEO honesty features, pinned from the app's side.

Two contracts land with the 2.6.0 floor:

1. **Icon discovery agrees with the declaration.** This app still declares
   `configure_seo(icons=[...])` explicitly (declared wins), but the fleet's
   satellites will increasingly rely on discovery alone — so the reference
   host proves the two produce the SAME set. Set-equality, not order: the
   release notes are explicit that discovery orders differently
   (.ico first, biggest square descending, apple-touch last) and that
   order-inequality is not a failure.

2. **The sitemap tells the truth or says nothing.** `<lastmod>` is emitted
   verbatim from frontmatter `lastmod:` and omitted when unset. No date in
   the sitemap may exist that no page declared — the invented daily "today"
   is the exact lie 2.6.0 exists to end.
