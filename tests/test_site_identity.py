"""Site identity: one brand, every surface, verbatim.

The network standard says a site states what it is in the same words
everywhere an agent or a reader can reach. The failure this pins is silent,
which is why it needs tests rather than a code review: nothing errors when a
surface falls back to a default. On this host, before `SITE_BRAND` existed,
the llms viewer's brand chip read a bare **"Dash"** — the `Dash()`
constructor's default title, leaking out as the public identity of a
production documentation site.

dash-improve-my-llms 2.3.4's `resolve_site_title` is what makes the fix
possible: it takes the home page's registered `name` first, `app.title`
second, and *skips* generic candidates ("Home", "Index", "Dash") rather than
publishing them. These tests assert both ends of that — the inputs this repo
controls, and the H1 it produces.
